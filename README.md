This project presents a machine learning-based solution to detect fake news articles using logistic regression. It leverages the power of natural language processing by applying TF-IDF vectorization to transform news content into numerical features. The model is trained on labeled data to distinguish between real and fake news, improving information reliability and trust. Emphasis is placed on text cleaning and feature extraction to enhance prediction accuracy. The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries like scikit-learn and pandas. Itâ€™s designed to be easily interpretable and extendable for larger datasets or alternate classifiers. This is an ideal starter project for applying supervised learning in NLP.
